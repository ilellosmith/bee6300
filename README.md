# bee6300
This is a repository to hold code from Cornell's Biological and Environmental Engineering 6300 - Multivariate Environmental Statistics - course. 
I wrote the R scripts for course assignments, exploring methods include Fischer's Linear Discrimination, multiple linear regression, classification, copula models, and Principle Component Analysis. 
Cornell Professor Scott Steinschneider (https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/scott-steinschneider/), provided starter code for each of the assignments. I modified his starter code and added my own loops and functions to accomplish the assignments.
