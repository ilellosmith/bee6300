This script applies Fischer's linear discrimination to land type classification. It compares model accuracy
using spectral information as the only input to model accuracy using spectral information and generated superobject data. 

The inspiration for the comparison came from Johnson & Xie (2013). Full citation: 
Johnson, B., & Xie, Z. (2013). Classifying a high resolution image of an urban area using superobject
information. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 83, 40â€“49.

Johnson & Xie (2013) used Random Forest algorithms to distinguish between land types. In conjunction with their paper, this script can also
be used to compare accuracy of Fischer's linear discrimination to Random Forest.
