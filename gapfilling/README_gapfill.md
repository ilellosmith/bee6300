The R script and uploaded data models how annual precipitation totals co-vary across 4 rain gages 
along the southern shore of Lake Ontario in New York State.
The script first assesses normality in the data, then gap-fills for missing data, and finally, 
assesses whether the mean precipitation for gages has shifted over the 31 year data set.
