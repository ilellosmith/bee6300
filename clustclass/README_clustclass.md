The R scripts and data contained in clustclass explore clustering and classification methods using stream parameters 
and the presence or absence of brook trout in Maryland. Visualizations and techniques include dendrograms, K-means clustering, and the
use of a discrimination function to predict if new stream catchments are likely to have brook trout or not.
